##changes required
#
#	Estimated mean R(n) -> True mean E(R)
#	confidence interval should be within 90%-99%, for accuracy and performance 95% is taken as default
#	calculate following formulaes
#
#	SumR	=	SumR + Rn
#	Sumsqr	=	Sumsqr	+	Rn*Rn	
#	Rmean	=	SumR	/	n
#	Rsqmean	=	Sumsqr	/	n
#	Rvariance	=	Rsqmean	-	Rmean	*	Rsqmean
#	Rstd	=	sqrt(Rvariance)
#	
#	Rmean	+-	1.960	*	Rstd	/	sqrt(n)				for 95% confidence interval
#	
#	Confidence interval calculation	(min samples 40)
